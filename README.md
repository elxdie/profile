Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my first-day project at Le Wagon bootcamp! I dived into HTML and CSS to create a simple yet personalized profile page that introduces myself. This project allowed me to get a hands-on experience with the basics of web development and design.

## Project Highlights

- **HTML Structure:** The HTML file (`index.html`) lays out the structure of the profile page. I used semantic HTML tags to organize the content and create a clear structure.

- **CSS Styling:** The CSS file (`styles.css`) is responsible for styling the profile page. I applied basic styling to enhance the visual appeal, ensuring that the design reflects my personality.

- **Personal Description:** I included a brief description of myself on the page, links to my favorite website and social media .


*Open the Profile Page:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view my profile page.

## Added Links

Here are the links i added to the page:

## Future Steps

Although this project is a simple introduction to web development, I'm excited to explore more advanced concepts in the coming weeks of the bootcamp. I plan to enhance my profile page by adding interactive elements, improving styling, and possibly integrating it with backend technologies.

## Contributions

As I continue my journey in Le Wagon bootcamp, I welcome any suggestions or contributions to help improve my profile page and enhance my understanding of web development.
